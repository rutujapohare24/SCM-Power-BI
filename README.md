Inventory Analysis using Power BI

## Supply Chain Management Analysis Dashboard 

### Overview:
This repository contains a Supply Chain Management Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into inventory management, sales performance, profitability, and more based on data from five tables: Region, Customer, Sales, Product, and Warehouse. Additionally, a Date table has been created based on the Sales table for time-based analysis.

### Features:
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The dashboard includes interactive charts and slicers to analyze various aspects of supply chain management, such as revenue, cost, profit, inventory analysis, and transaction trends.
- **Measures and Calculations**: Several measures and calculations have been implemented using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive insights, including revenue, cost, total transactions, procured cost, profit margin, and more.
- **Top 5 Analysis**: The dashboard showcases top 5 products based on profit margin and top 5 products based on procured cost, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
- **Inventory Analysis**: Inventory management metrics such as inventory in progress and order in progress are analyzed to optimize inventory levels and enhance operational efficiency.

### Usage:
- **Data Source**: The dashboard utilizes data from Excel files containing the Region, Customer, Sales, Product, and Warehouse tables. Ensure that these data files are accessible and properly formatted for use in Power BI.
- **Data Modeling**: Data modeling has been performed to establish relationships between tables and create calculated measures. The connection between the Sales and Date tables has been kept inactive for flexibility in measure creation.
- **Dashboard Interaction**: Users can interact with the dashboard through slicers and filters to explore different aspects of supply chain management and analyze data dynamically.
- **Deployment**: The dashboard can be deployed in Power BI Service or shared as a PBIX file for offline use. Ensure proper data refresh schedules are set up for up-to-date insights.

### How to Run:
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI file (PBIX) using Power BI Desktop.
3. Ensure that the necessary data files are accessible and properly connected.
4. Explore the dashboard by interacting with the visualizations, slicers, and filters.
